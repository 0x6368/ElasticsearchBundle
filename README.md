# ONGR Elasticsearch Bundle

Elasticsearch Bundle was created in order to serve the need for
professional [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) integration with enterprise level Symfony
2 systems. This bundle is:

* Supported by [ONGR.io](http://ongr.io) development team.
* Uses the official [elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) client.
* Ensures full integration with Symfony 2 framework.

Technical goodies:

* Provides nestable and DSL query builder to be executed by type repository services.
* Uses Doctrine-like document / entities document-object mapping using annotations.
* Query results iterators are provided for your convenience.
* Registers console commands for index and types management and data import / export.
* Designed in an extensible way for all your custom needs.
