## Elasticsearch Bundle

Welcome to the ElasticsearchBundle, the modern solution to work with [Elasticsearch database](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) in the [Symfony 2](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) applications. We created this bundle with love :heart: and we think you will love it too.

#### Very first steps to begin
* [Setup](setup.md)
* [Configuration](configuration.md)

#### Usage
* [Create you first mapping](mapping_simplified.md)
* [Explaining all mapping details](mapping_advanced.md)
* [Console commands](commands.md)
* [How to create search](search.md)
* [Parsing results](results_parsing.md)

#### Troubleshooting
* [Want to upgrade from v0.10*](upgrade.md)

#### Some news for upcoming versions

We already have a new milestone set for v1.1.0 version (see active milestones [here](https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchBundle/milestones)). For the new milestone we are planning to support new endpoints:
* Highlight
* Autocomplete
* Suggestions

We are hoping that those features will help our community to create better projects. ** If you think that we are missing something very important which would help you, please do not hesitate to create an issue and ask about it.** We are very open and looking forward to see a projects running on this awesome bundle :smirk:.
